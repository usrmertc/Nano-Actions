<h1 align=center> Nano Actions </h1>

I created `Nano Actions` for the Chrome Built-in Challenge. This Chrome extension helps you take real-time notes while browsing, with the support of Gemini Nano AI. Right now, it saves notes to `Google Docs`. I'm planning to add more Google Workspace integrations as new features become available.

In the future, you might find yourself using the Nano Actions extension to quickly put together reports, presentations, and take notes
